I am working as a Consultant Engineer at [ALTEN Belgium](https://www.alten.be/) under projects in the automotive, aeronautical and energy sectors.

I hold a Double MSc in Industrial Engineering, with a major in mechanics from the [UPV/EHU](https://www.ehu.eus/es/), in Spain, and in aeronautics from the [ENSAM](https://artsetmetiers.fr/fr), in France. 

During my training, I have acquired experience in material design and characterisation of metallic alloys for the LPBF additive manufacturing technique at [Constellium](https://www.constellium.com/), and also in the synthesis and characterisation of additively manufactured bio-composites, working under the supervision of the [MSMP Laboratory](https://www.msmp.eu/) and the [ZIBIO Group](https://www.ehu.eus/es/web/enpresa/-/science-and-engineering-of-polymeric-biomaterials-zibio-), throughout different internships.
